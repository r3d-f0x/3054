# 30-54 Rule & Policy

The rules defined here apply across all 30-54 services.

##  Rules for all users

On 30-54, all users are expected to abide by the following rules:

* No incitement of illegal activity
* No redistribution of copyright protected work that you do not have rights to
* No illegal or borderline illegal content or sharing links to such content
* No gore
* No hardcore porn
* Don't post exclusively self promoting content.  There isn't a specific ratio for self promotion posts but it should be clear that you aren't just spamming your own content.
* No unwanted personal information of any kind
* No brigading or dogpiling

### Free speech policy

To the maximum extent possible, the administrators of 30-54 will uphold the right to freely express ideas.  The sad reality is that there are people online who would abuse a true free speech policy in such away that would drive out any users who could contribute to productive conversation and create a cesspit that only they would play in.  In order to protect the future of the site and make sure that it is a place where contributing and productive users will spend time, bigotry will not be allowed.  Tolerance will be given to users who express politically incorrect opinions on issues that are on the leading edge of progressive causes.  Edgy or offensive memes or humor may be allowed as long as it is clear that the user is not sincerly promoting hate, though such forms of humor are discouraged.

## Rules for moderators

* Moderators are responsible for the content of their communities
* Moderator bans are allowed only for user conduct within their communities
